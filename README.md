# abrid-icon-theme
A hybrid Icon theme for Linux Desktops 

This icon theme is based off antu with changes from other icon themes as listed below and further info in the COPYING file and LICENSES folder. The file origin.md lists where each file comes from.

As this is based off Antu it should have the icons required for most desktops.

## Todo
